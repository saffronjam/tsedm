/// ### From Best Effort to Causal Order Reliable Broadcast

/// This is the first programming assignment where you will have to build and reuse multiple components.  
/// Starting bottom-up, you will first have to implement _best effort broadcast_, then _reliable broadcast_ and finally _causal order reliable broadcast_.  
/// Mind that passing each component check will give you a **partial** grade and therefore you will need to pass **all** checks to get the full grade for this programming assignment.

/// **Things to Remember**:  
/// 1. Some components such as `PerfectLink`, `Network` and `Timer` are already provided. No need to implement them.  
/// 2. Execute the imports defined below **before** compiling your component implementations.  
/// 3. We recommend making use of the component state and internal messages we have provided, if any, to complete the implementation logic.  
/// 4. You can always print messages to the output log, from within handlers to see what happens during the simulation. e.g. `println(s"Process $self delivers message $msg");`  
/// 5. Remember that during the simulation check you can print and observe the simulation time, i.e. with `System.currentTimeMillis()`.  
/// 5. Do not forget to run the checker code block after each component implementation to ensure that all properties are satisfied before exporting and submitting the notebook.  

/// Good luck! :)

/// ### Part I: Best-Effort Broadcast

/// A Best-Effort Broadcast Abstraction (BEB), in Kompics terms, is a component that **provides** the following port _(already imported in the notebook)_.

/// ```
/// class BestEffortBroadcast extends Port {
/// indication[BEB_Deliver];
/// request[BEB_Broadcast];
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// A **BEB** component should request `BEB_Broadcast` and indicate `BEB_Deliver` events as defined below:
///
/// ```
/// case class BEB_Deliver(source: Address, payload: KompicsEvent) extends KompicsEvent;
/// case class BEB_Broadcast(payload: KompicsEvent) extends KompicsEvent;
/// ```
///
/// As you have already learnt from the course lectures, Best-Effort Broadcast should satisfy the following properties:
///
/// 1.  **Validity**: _If a correct process broadcasts a message m, then every correct process eventually delivers m._
/// 2.  **No duplication**: _No message is delivered more than once._
/// 3.  **No creation**: _If a process delivers a message m with sender s, then m was previously broadcast by process s._
/// 
/// HINT: The recommended algorithm to use in this assignment is _Basic Broadcast_ and is described in the following [document](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/a91e7d1ac75367325c1efd101a9e2138/asset-v1:KTHx+ID2203.1x+2016T3+type@asset+block/basicbroadcast.pdf) in the respective lecture.

/// 2.  No duplication: _No message is delivered more than once._

/// #### Working with Vector Clocks
/// 
/// We have already provided you a `VectorClock` data structure **(already imported)** to aid you with the algorithm implementation. You can briefly see the supported operations below:
/// 
/// ```
///  case class VectorClock(var vc: Map[Address, Int]) {
///   def inc(addr: Address) : Unit  //increases the clock corresponding to the address @addr provided
///   def set(addr: Address, value: Int) : Unit //sets the clock of @addr to @value
///   def <=(that: VectorClock): Boolean   //returns true if this vector clock instance is lower or equal to @that
///  }
///  object VectorClock {
///    def empty(topology: scala.Seq[Address]): VectorClock //generates a vector clock that has an initial clock value of 0 for each address in the @topology provided
///    def apply(that: VectorClock): VectorClock //copy constructor of a vector clock. E.g. if vc1 is a vector clock vc2 = VectorClock(vc1) is a copy of vc1
///  }
/// ```
/// 
/// In case you want to check the full implementation of the VectorClock, you can find it in our full published gist [here](https://gist.github.com/senorcarbone/5c960ee27a67ec8b6bd42c33303fdcd2).
